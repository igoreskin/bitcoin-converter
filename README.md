This is a simple but practical Node.js application that creates a bitcoin wallet with an account number and a Private Key, as well as converts bitcoins into US dollars and back using the real-time conversion rate. In the Wallet view, a user can enter a mnemonic, which essentially is a random combination of words, and the application generates an account number, as well as a Private Key used for signing bitcoin transactions, using a SHA-256 cryptographic hash function. In the Converter view, a user can enter an amount in bitcoins, and the application calculates the respective amount in USD, or vice versa. The application has been built using Express where HTTP requests are implemented with the Request module.
